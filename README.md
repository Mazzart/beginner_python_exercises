# beginner_python_exercises
Solutions for 36 beginner Python exercises from practicepython.org (folder 1-36 includes solution to the exercises).

Other files include solutions for various tasks:
1) the program that generates a list of prime numbers in a given range (list_of_prime_numbers.py)
2) the program that generates a list of Fibonacci numbers in a given range (fibonacci_numbers.py)
3) the program asks the user to enter a number (length of the list) generates a random list then sorts it the first part is sorted even numbers and the second part - sorted odd numbers (bubble_sort_even_odd.py)
4) the program asks the user to enter a number (length of the list) generates two random lists then sorts them using selection sort (selection_sort.py) sorts them in reverse order using selection sort (selection_sort_reversed.py)
5) the program does the same thing as bubble_sort_even_odd.py but with another algorithm (another_sort_even_odd.py)
6) the program searches the position of a value in the generated list (binary_search.py)
7) the progma finds the largest common divisor for two numbers (greater_common_divisor.py)
