# SoftFormance School exercises
Solutions for different Python exercises. Below you can find description of some programs:

1) the program that generates a list of prime numbers in a given range (list_of_prime_numbers.py)
2) the program that generates a list of Fibonacci numbers in a given range (fibonacci_numbers.py)
3) the program asks the user to enter a number (length of the list) generates a random list then sorts it the first part is sorted even numbers and the second part - sorted odd numbers (bubble_sort_even_odd.py)
4) the program asks the user to enter a number (length of the list) generates two random lists then sorts them using selection sort (selection_sort.py) sorts them in reverse order using selection sort (selection_sort_reversed.py)
5) the program does the same thing as bubble_sort_even_odd.py but with another algorithm (another_sort_even_odd.py)
6) the program searches the position of a value in the generated list (binary_search.py)
7) the program finds the largest common divisor for two numbers (greater_common_divisor.py)
8) the program generates a sorted list of numbers by the frequency of entry in a descending order (sort_freq_desc_order.py)
9) the program sorts a list of Fibonacci numbers using selection sort (selection_sort_fibonacci_list.py)
10) the program sorts list of numbers in reversed order using merge sort (merge_sort_reversed.py)
11) the program sorts list of numbers using quick sort (quick_sort.py)
12) the program finds the sum of two numbers in the sorted list closest to the given number (closest_sum_of_two.py)
